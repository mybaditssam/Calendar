# Work Day Scheduler
This is a simple HTML and JavaScript application for creating a work day scheduler. It allows you to schedule tasks for different hours of the day. 

## Getting Started
To use the Work Day Scheduler, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. The project relies on:
- Bootstrap:
- jQuery
- Day.js


## Functionality
The JavaScript code in the script.js file provides the following functionality:

Setting the current date in the header using Day.js.
Saving and retrieving tasks from localStorage.
Applying different styling to the time blocks based on the current time.
Past hours are styled with a "past" class.
The current hour is styled with a "present" class.
Future hours are styled with a "future" class.
